This repo is now longer maintained bcs it was previously linked with my Gitbook Docs website.
I've decided to make my own docs website, and for loading times purpose I decided to now longer use Github repo.
The API takes way too long to respond versus markdown files directly hosted on my webhost, considering the huge amount of game functions there is too load.

You can find my new docs here: https://docs.redmods.com/

Thank you for your understanding !

> [!NOTE]
> If you still want to suggest a change to my new documentation, you can still do a pull requests here on this docs and I will eventually update the changes accordingly to my website.
